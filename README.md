# Planet-Comparison
ASEN 1969 Sample of Work Project

This program compares the major objects in the solar system with Earth by:

  mass (-m),
  diameter (-d),
  distance from the Sun (-s),
  length of year (-y) --> for planets only (not moons),
  length of day (-a), 
  surface gravitational acceleration (-g)
  
The objects that are included in this program are:

  Earth (duh),
  Mercury,
  Venus,
  Mars,
  Jupiter,
  Saturn,
  Uranus,
  Neptune,
  Pluto,
  Eris,
  Moon (Earth),
  Io,
  Europa,
  Ganymede,
  Callisto,

  Enceladus.
  
An example call is like this:
  ./planetcomp -d Ganymede OR
  ./planetcomp -m Uranus.
  
Calls like these will print a usage messge and/or Earth's statistics
  ./planetcomp OR
  ./planetcomp -f Mars OR
  ./planetcomp -s Andromeda.
 
Happy Comparing
